# HTML Copycat Exercise
What's one of your favorite websites to visit? Imitation is the highest form of flattery, so why don't you try to imitate it?

- Open up the webpage and keep it open as reference
- Create a basic webpage wih that webpage's content (or atleast a small subset of it, like one blog post if its a blog).
- Set up the layout for the webpage using a framework like Twitter Bootstrap.
- Change the text and background color to match.
- Figure out if you need a custom font to match their font.
- Keep going until it looks close!
