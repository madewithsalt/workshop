# HTML Event Invite Exercise
What's an upcoming event that you're organizing or that you're attending and want others to come to? Create a webpage for that event!

## Steps
- Create a basic webpage with the event name, logistical information (in a table), and an embedded Google Map of where it is.
- Create a Google form and embed it on the page.
- Come up with a color scheme, using [Color Scheme Designer](http://paletton.com/) or [ColourLovers](http://www.colourlovers.com/), and apply that using CSS to parts of your page.
- Find a [Google Web Font](google.com/fonts) that suits your event theme, and use that for the headers of your page.
