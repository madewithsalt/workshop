The goal of this exercise is to make a Mad Libs generator.

The second half of [these slides](http://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/slides/animevents.html) may be useful.

Start with this webpage, which has several input elements and a button:
{% codeblock %}
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title></title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Mad Libs</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Noun: <input type="text" id="noun">
      <li>Adjective: <input type="text" id="adjective">
      <li>Someone's Name: <input type="text" id="name">
    </ul>
    <button id="lib-button">Lib it!</button>
    <div id="story"></div>
  </body>
  </html>
{% endcodeblock %} 

- Add a script tag to the bottom of the page for your code.
- Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a `makeMadLib` function when clicked.
- In the `makeMadLib` function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
